Gherkin Feature Stanzas
=======================

.. rst-class:: bullet 

* There can only be one feature per file

* Every feature starts with:

  * Feature: {Title}

* Followed by narrative:

  * In order to {achieve a benefit}
  * As a {role or user}
  * I need to {do something}

.. note::

      The feature stanza is never executed, but it *is* parsed. The "Feature:" label MUST be present at the top of each feature file.

Gherkin Scenario Format
=======================

**Given**:  Defines the initial state of the system for the scenario

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Given I am on the homepage

**When**: Describes the action performed on the system

.. code-block:: gherkin

  When I press "Log in"

**Then**: Describes the system state after the action has been performed

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Then I should see "Username field is required"

**And**, **But**: Can be added to any of the above

.. code-block:: gherkin

  And I should see "Password field is required"

.. rst-class:: bullet build

* Each line is called a Step
* Each step is supported by PHP code

The whole feature
=================

``features/login.feature``

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Feature: Maintain content
    In order to maintain site content
    As an editor
    I need to log in

    Scenario: Enter valid username and password // Happy path
      Given I am on the homepage
      When I fill in "admin" for "Username"
      And I fill in "admin" for "Password"
      And I press "Log in"
      Then I should see "Add content"

    Scenario: Fail to enter username or password // Less happy path
      Given I am on the homepage
      When I press "Log in"
      Then I should see "Username field is required"
      And I should see "Password field is required"

Scenario Style
==============

.. rst-class:: build bullet

* Every scenario is indendent
* Always from perspecitve of the role identified in the feature
* No more than 6 - 8 scenarios per feature
* One Given: Set the scene
* One When: Change the scene
* One Then: Observe the outcome
* Each with as many Ands or Buts as needed

Example
-------

Once a step definition is written in PHP, the step can be re-used: 

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Scenario: Access free content
    Given I am on "/series/learning-sass-and-compass"
    When I follow "What is a CSS Preprocessor?"
    Then I should see "What is a CSS Preprocessor?"
    And I should see "Interactive Transcripts"
