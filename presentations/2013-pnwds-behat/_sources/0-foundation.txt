Quality Assurance using Behat and the Drupal Extension
======================================================

.. include:: byline.inc

Because Drupal has:
===================

.. rst-class:: build bullet
 
* Powerful value added by non-developers
* Complex module interactivity
* Frequent security updates with functionality changes 

We need to:
===========

.. rst-class:: build bullet

* Know how users are expected to move through the application
* Know how the application is expected to respond
* Keep that knowledge in sync with changes
* Test that those user paths work 

Because our applications are:
=============================

.. rst-class:: build bullet

* dependent on third-party libraries
* integrated with third-party services
* highly visible
* globally accessible 


We need to be able to:
======================

.. rst-class:: build bullet

* Develop rapidly
* Deploy frequently

Describe
========
Our goal is to describe application behavior in a way ...

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Feature: Forum posts on front page
    In order to see recent activity and news in the forums
    As any user
    I should be able to view links to the latest forum posts on the front page


    Scenario: Forum Posts tab on front page
      Given there is a new "Paid Drupal services" forum topic
      And the cache is cleared
      And I am on the homepage
      When I follow "Forum Posts"
      Then I should see the forum topic link
      And I should see the link "More forums"

Automate
========

...that we can turn into automated, browser-clicking functional tests:

.. raw:: html

From a BDD Perspective
======================

.. rst-class:: build

* Automatable functional tests are *only* a bonus

  * They are **not** the primary goal of BDD
  * They do **not** replace unit tests

* BDD is about

  * Discovering what we need to build
  * Ensuring what we build has value
  * When we test, focusing our tests on the *right* things  

Types of Testing
================

.. rst-class:: build bullet

* Unit Testing (Classes or methods)
* Integration Testing (Multiple classes interacting)
* Functional Testing (Automated testing against acceptance criteria)
* GUI Testing (Automated testing in a graphical brower)
* Manual Testing (Human click-testing)

At the Core
===========

.. rst-class:: build bullet

  * TDD tests tell programmers their code is working
  * BDD tests ensure that the application is delivering business value

The Roots of BDD: Test-Driven Development
=========================================

* Cycle: 

  * Add a test
  * Run tests and see the new one fail
  * Write some code
  * Run the automated tests and see them succeed
  * Refactor code
  * Repeat

* Purpose

  * Encourage simple designs
  * Facilitate short release cycles
  * Provide higher confidence in releases
 
Behavior-Driven Development
===========================

Behavior-driven development emerged from test-driven development, to answer these questions:

.. rst-class:: build bullet

*  Where do I start?
*  What do I test?
*  How much do I test in one go?
*  What do I call the tests?
*  How can I understand why a test fails?

Fundamental Principles of Story BDD
===================================

Ignorance
---------

.. epigraph:: 

    Ignorance is the biggest constraint in software development

    -- Dan North

Value
-----

.. epigraph::

    Every feature should have a measurable business value


Communication
-------------

.. epigraph::

    Everyone on the team should have a common language to describe the site

Conversation
------------

.. epigraph::

    | Having conversations
    | is more important than
    | Capturing conversations
    | is more important than 
    | Automating conversations

  -- Liz Keough
