Elaborate with Scenarios
========================

Add scenarios to each feature in order to:

.. rst-class:: build bullet

  * Elicit additional expectations from product owners
  * Uncover unknowns before work is accepted in a sprint
  * Communicate to developers what needs to be implemented
  * Demonstrate software meets acceptance criteria
  * Provide a foundation for change orders
  * Eventually, create automated tests

When to elaborate
=================

.. rst-class:: build bullet

* Important scenarios sometimes written alongside features
* Most detail is usually added **after** a feature is chosen for implementation 
* Too much detail may bog down understanding of full scope
* Why detail something that may never be built?

What to describe
================

.. rst-class:: build bullet

* Don't try to test every permutation

* Cover valuable paths

* The happy paths: When the user does what you want them to

.. rst-class:: build bullet

* The less happy paths: When you need to direct the user to do something else

  * A required field was left blank
  * Data was entered in an unexpected format
  * Terms of service weren't accepted
  * A search returns no results

Who elaborates?
===============

.. rst-class:: column-1  build

* Elaboration is a collaboration between:

  * Project managers
  * Product owners
  * Developers
  * Testers

.. rst-class:: column-2 build

* Emphasize providing: 

  * Enough guidance for developers
  * Enough flexibility for implementation
  * Keep it flexible
  * Avoid implementation details
  * Don't try to stuff it into pre-existing steps

Gherkin Scenario Format
=======================

**Given**:  Defines the initial state of the system for the scenario

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Given I am on the homepage

**When**: Describes the action performed on the system

.. code-block:: gherkin

  When I press "Log in"

**Then**: Describes the system state after the action has been performed

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Then I should see "Username field is required"

**And**, **But**: Can be added to any of the above

.. code-block:: gherkin

  And I should see "Password field is required"

.. rst-class:: bullet build

* Each line is called a Step
* Each step is supported by PHP code

The whole feature
=================

``features/login.feature``

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Feature: Maintain content
    In order to maintain site content
    As an editor
    I need to log in

    Scenario: Enter valid username and password // Happy path
      Given I am on the homepage
      When I fill in "admin" for "Username"
      And I fill in "admin" for "Password"
      And I press "Log in"
      Then I should see "Add content"

    Scenario: Fail to enter username or password // Less happy path
      Given I am on the homepage
      When I press "Log in"
      Then I should see "Username field is required"
      And I should see "Password field is required"

Scenario Style
==============

.. rst-class:: build bullet

* Every scenario is indendent
* Always from perspecitve of the role identified in the feature
* No more than 6 - 8 scenarios per feature
* One Given: Set the scene
* One When: Change the scene
* One Then: Observe the outcome
* Each with as many Ands or Buts as needed

Example
-------

Once a step definition is written in PHP, the step can be re-used: 

.. code-block:: gherkin

  Scenario: Access free content
    Given I am on "/series/learning-sass-and-compass"
    When I follow "What is a CSS Preprocessor?"
    Then I should see "What is a CSS Preprocessor?"
    And I should see "Interactive Transcripts"
