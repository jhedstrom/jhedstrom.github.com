Selecting which Tests to Run
============================

Group tests by:

.. rst-class:: build bullet

* Feauture file name
* File name and scenario line number
* Directory or subdirectory
* Arbitrary tag
* Feature and scenario name
 
Based on Specific .feature File
===============================

``bin/behat features/byfile.feature``
   All scenarios in the feature, no wildcards allowed
``bin/behat features/byfile.feature:21``
   A scenario beginning on line 21. Supply the line number with Scenario: or Scenario Outline:, not the line with tags (if any)

Based on File Structure
=======================

``bin/behat`` 
  Everything in ``yourproject/features``, recursively
``bin/behat/subfolder``
   Everything in that folder, recursively

You can't run them with wildcards.

Based on Feature or Scenario Names
==================================

The JUnit output in Jenkins shows only name, not the file or line number, etc.

``bin/behat --name "Add a case study"``
  All the scenarios in the feature file
``bin/behat --name "View case study guidelines"``
   A specific scenario
``bin/behat --name "case"``
  All features or scenarios with the word case in their title

Based on Tags
=============

.. rst-class:: build bullet

* You can make up arbiratry tags and run scenarios based on those tags.
* Tagging the Feature is the equivilent of tagging all scenarios in it
* Scenarios can be tagged with more than one tag (but it must be on the same line)
* You can use complex logic with tags

Magic tags
==========

@javascript
   Will cause a test to use a configured Web browser rather than the default text-only

@api
  Will cause the test to use the Drupal API, and will only succeed if the tests and site are on the same machine

Conventions
===========

@wip 
  denotes a feature or scenario that is not finished

@silence
  denotes a test that shouldn't be included in Continuous Integration because it's unreliable (or for any other reason)
